# Connects3Angular
This project was generated with Angular CLI. The main objective was to put in practice my basic knowledgement about angular.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
